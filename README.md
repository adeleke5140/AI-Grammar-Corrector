# AI-Grammar-Corrector
Using the OpenAI Grammar correction model, this web app would be able to take English riddled with errors and return with proper grammar.

Building with:
1. `ReactJs`
2. `Axios`
3. `openAi api`

As with any React App I create, I start from sketching out the overall structure of the app. I use the app Whimsical of that.
It helps me visualize what goes where.
